This module provides preprocessing utilities for preparing data before training neural networks.

Functions:
    - min_max_scaler: Scales features to a given range, typically [0, 1]
    - train_test_split: Splits data into training and testing sets
    - one_hot_encode: Converts categorical labels into a one-hot encoded format
