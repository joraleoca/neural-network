"""
This module implements various optimization algorithms commonly used in training neural networks.
Each optimizer is implemented as a concrete class inheriting from the abstract
Optimizer base class.

Classes:
    - Optimizer: Abstract base class defining the interface for optimization algorithms
    - SGD: Implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer
    - Adam: Implementation of the Adam optimizer
